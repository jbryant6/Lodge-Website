            <span><p>Prince Hall History</p></span>
            <ol>
                <li>The history of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge shows, that Prince Hall and fourteen men of Color were made Masons on March 6, 1775 at Castle William Island in Boston Harbor, in Army Lodge #441, which marked the first time that black men were made Masons in America.</li>
                <li>One year later, the British Foot Infantry left Boston along with its Lodge, leaving Prince Hall and his associates without a Lodge; but before the Lodge left, Worshipful Master J.B. Batt gave them a Permit to meet as a Lodge and bury their dead in manner and form: This Permit however, did not allow them to do any Masonic work or to take in any new members.</li>
                <li>Under this Permit, African Lodge was organized on July 3, 1776 with Prince Hall as Worshipful Master, and it was not long, before this Lodge received an additional “Permit” from Provincial Grand Master John Rowe to walk in procession on Saint John’s day.</li>
                <li>On March 2, 1784, African Lodge #1 petitioned the Grand Lodge of England (the premier Grand Lodge of the world) for a Warrant or Charter to organize a regular Masonic Lodge, with all the rights and privileges thereunto prescribed.</li>
                <li>The Grand Lodge of England issued a Charter on September 29, 1784 to African Lodge #459, the first Lodge of Blacks in America.</li>
                <li>In 1797, Prince Hall organized a Lodge in Philadelphia Pennsylvania and one in Providence Rhode-Island; these Lodges were designated to work under the Charter of African Lodge #459</li>
                <li>In December 1808, one year after the death of Prince Hall, African Lodge #459 (Boston),African Lodge #459 (Philadelphia) and Hiram Lodge #3 (Providence, Rhode-Island) met in a general assembly of the Craft and organized African Grand Lodge sometimes referred to as African Grand Lodge #1.</li>
                <li>In 1847, out of respect for their founder and first Grand Master Prince Hall, they changed their name to Prince Hall Grand Lodge, The name it carries today.</li>
                <li>In 1848, Union Lodge #2, Rising Sons of St. John’s #3 and Celestial Lodge #4 became the first Lodges organized under the name Prince Hall Grand Lodge.</li>
                <li>The Grand Lodge of Louisiana, named Eureka was established on January 5, 1863 at the hall of Richmond Lodge No. 4 between Customhouse and Bienville streets.</li>
                <li>In 1944, the act of incorporation for the Eureka Grand Lodge was amended and the organization was renamed the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons of Louisiana.</li>
                <li>From these beginnings, there now are 5,000 Lodges and 47 Grand Lodges who trace their lineage to the Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Jurisdiction of Massachusetts.</li>
                <li>November 24, 1994, Grand Master Locker received written documents from Grand Secretary Higham, stating that a resolution will be considered by the United Grand Lodge of England at the December 14, 1994 Session, stating that, “notwithstanding its unusual formation the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts should be considered as regular and be recognized.” The Grand Lodge of England’s news letter stated that this recognition applies only to the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, and applications for other Prince Hall Grand Lodges may follow and each must be considered on its merit.</li>
