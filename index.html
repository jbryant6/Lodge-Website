                <p>Greetings,</p>
                <p>It is my hope and desire for us to take Prince Hall Masonry to a different level, as we seek to improve our Fraternity. Many times we read the ritual and we are able to recite verbatim what is written. However, we cannot seem to apply those words in our DAILY life. We all can contribute to the growth and enrichment of our Fraternity for there are no “I” or “U” in Team or Brotherhood. The various degrees we took has an everlasting binding commitment to God, Family, and Country.</p>
                <p>Let us not forget our obligation to the forefathers of our Fraternity whose vision for Prince Hall Masonry was to teach, mentor and pass-on the Legacy to future generations the commitment of community service</p><br>

    <section id="Closing">
        <div class="container">
            <p>How quickly we want to rest on past laurels, not realizing that history dictates we must continue to press forward to higher heights. Our founding fathers only past the torch, they did not complete the race.</p>
            <p>It is our responsibility to continue the race and cross the finish line. Some of our Prince Hall Masons have stopped running the race due to lack of stamina, some due to lack of interest and most of the others due to lack of guidance.</p>
            <p>I submit to each of you to become a committee of one to insure that the race is ran to its finish line. You can and should make a difference!!! The tenets of Prince Hall have not changed since 1775, when we first took up the gauntlet to compete.</p>
            <p>Look inward to find the fire that will make your journey worthwhile. Selfless service is what Prince Hall Masonry is all about.</p><br>
