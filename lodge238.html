            <span><p>Who is Prince Hall?</p></span>
            <p>Prince Hall is recognized as the Father of Black Masonry in the United States. He made it possible for us to also be recognized and enjoy all privileges of free and accepted masonry. It is generally accepted that Prince Hall was free born in British West Indies. His father, Thomas Prince Hall, was an Englishman and his mother a free colored woman of French extraction.</p>
            <p>In 1765, he worked his passage on a ship to Boston, where he worked as a leather worker, a trade learned from his father. Eight years later he had acquired real estate and was qualified to vote. Religiously inclined, he later became a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church with a charge in Cambridge.</p>
            <p>Black Free Masonry began when Prince Hall and fourteen other free black men were initiated into Lodge No. 441, Irish Constitution attached to the 38th Regiment of Foot, British Army Garrisoned at Castle Williams (now Fort Independence) Boston Harbor on March 1775. The Master of the Lodge being one Sergeant John Batt.</p>
            <p>When the British Army left Boston, this Lodge, No. 441, granted Prince Hall and his brethren authority to meet as a Lodge, to go in procession on St. John's Day, and as a Lodge to bury their dead; but they could not confer degrees nor perform any other Masonic "work".</p>
            <p>For nine years these brethren, together with others who had received their degrees elsewhere, assembled and enjoyed their limited privileges as Masons. Finally, in March 1784, Prince Hall petitioned the Grand Lodge of England, through a Worshipful Master of a subordinate Lodge in London for a warrant or charter.</p>
            <span><p> Have You Ever Considered Becoming a Mason?</p></span>
            <p>Freemasonry is the oldest, largest Fraternity in the world. It's members have included Kings, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Statesmen, Generals, Admirals, Supreme Court Chief Justices, corporate CEOs, opera stars, movie stars, and probably, your next door neighbor. Masonry is always ready to welcome good men into the Fraternity. It is ready to welcome YOU, if in your heart you can answer "yes" to a few questions.</p>
            <span><p>Do you believe in a Supreme Being?</p></span>
            <p>No atheist can become a member of a Freemasonry Lodge. Masons do not care what your individual faith is that is a question between you and your God - but we do require that a man believe in a Supreme Being.</p>
            <span><p>Do you believe that it is more blessed to give than to receive, it is also more fun?</p></span>
            <p>Masons are involved with the problems and needs of others because we know it gives each of us a good feeling - unlike any other - to help. Much of our help is given anonymously. We are not after gratitude; we're more than rewarded by that feeling which comes from knowing we have helped people overcome some adversity, so that their life can go on.</p>
            <span><p>Are you willing to give help to your Brothers when they need it, and to accept their help when you need it?</p></span>
            <p>Masonry is mutual help. Not just financial help (although that's there too) but help in the sense of being there when needed, giving support, lending a sympathetic ear.</p>
            <span><p>Do you agree that man should show compassion for others, that goodness of heart is among the most important of human values?</p></span>
            <p>Masons do. We believe in a certain reverence for living things, a tenderness toward people who suffer. A loving kindness for our fellow man, and a desire to do right because it is right. Masonry teaches that although all men are fallible and capable of much wrong, when they discover the goodness of heart, they have found the true essence of virtue. Masonry helps men see their potential for deep goodness and virtue.</p>
            <span><p>Do you believe that men should strive to live a brotherly life?</p></span>
            <p>Masons see brotherhood as a form of wisdom, a sort of bond that holds men together - a private friendship that tells us we owe it to each other to be just in our dealings and to refuse to speak evil of each other. Masons believe a man should maintain an attitude of good will, and promote unity and harmony in his relations with one another, his family, and his community. Masons call this way of life believing in the Brotherhood of Man. It really means that every Mason makes it his duty to follow the golden rule. This is why Masonry has been called one the of greatest forces for good in the world.</p>
            <span><p>IF YOU ANSWERED "YES", YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BECOMING A MASON.</p></span>
            <p>Freemasonry offers much to its members - the opportunity to grow, the chance to make a difference, to build a better world for our children. It offers the chance to be with and work with men who have the same values and ideals men who have answered "YES" to these questions.</p>
